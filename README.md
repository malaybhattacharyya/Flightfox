# Flightfox Dataset

Flightfox is a competitive (but later turned into collaborative) crowdsourcing platform. In Flightfox, the flyers (i.e., requesters) try to avail the best itinerary (i.e., task) preferably involving minimum cost. The participating crowd workers compete (currently collaborate) to find out the best itinerary with minimum cost. Varying number of participants can participate in these contests. The winner is awarded a predefined fee and the task is closed. This is a standard rule for all the types of contests posted on Flightfox. For experimental analysis, we employ the data previously crawled from the crowdsourcing platform Flightfox [1], at a time when it was competitive. This data comprises a total of 13,056 contest details. The task details are collected from Flightfox for a span of about 2 years. Here, each row correspond to the details of a single contest. These contests were posted by flyers or passengers. The raw dataset contains several attributes.
